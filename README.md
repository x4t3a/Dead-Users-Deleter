How-to
------

Requirements
============
  1. [Python3](https://www.python.org/);
  2. [This VK module](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/vk);
  3. [A VK's standalone app's ID](https://vk.com/editapp?act=create) (optional as you can use mine: 6059559);
  4. [A VK access token](https://vk.com/dev/access_token)
     It must be generated by the account with the editor's or admin's access rights to the group;
  5. List of the "dead" users;
  6. Some patience.


How to get an access token
==========================
NB: keep the token in secret, as its holder gets the full access to your account!
  1. Follow [this link](https://oauth.vk.com/authorize?client_id=6059559&scope=notify,friends,photos,audio,video,docs,wall,notes,notifications,stats,ads,offline,status,groups&redirect_uri=https://oauth.vk.com/blank.html&display=page&response_type=token);
  2. Agree with the terms;
  3. When redirected, get the token from the address bar;


How to get the list of the "dead" users
=======================================
This script uses output of this [tool](https://vk.com/app2732533_364380749):
  1. Open it;
  2. Choose your community (make sure you've got at least editor's rights there);
  3. Proceed with the best scanning precision;
  4. Export the result as JSON.


How to do the thing
===================
  1. Create the "token" key in the root of your JSON file with your token as its value;
  2. Run the script with the path to your JSON supplied as the first argument.
     If no argument is supplied, the script will look for "config.json" in its directory.
  3. ???
  4. Profit!1

NB: That sleep for 3 seconds is necessary for VK may reject the API call if it's called more frequently.
